# learn_OCaml
This Repository contains files relating to the various exercises and tutorials I completed for learning Ocaml.
The motivation to learn OCaml is that this language is used for some aspects of the product development at my company.
I started knowing nothing about either OCaml, nor Functionl Programming, nor FL (Functional Languages), nor ML (Meta languages).


## First Activity: Real World Ocaml
I started my following the Guided Tour from RealWorldOCaml
https://dev.realworldocaml.org/guided-tour.html
This cource assumed that I was using a 'top-level' that was initialized with jane Street 'Base' or 'Core' libs.
My organization is not presently using these libs, so this learning pathway resulted in a bit of friction.

## Second Activity: OCmal Manual
I transitioned to reading through and following the examples in the OCaml Manual:
https://ocaml.org/manual/index.html
this did not make any assumptions about the top-level libs, and therefore i could use:
https://try.ocamlpro.com/ to impleement and evaluate OCaml in the browser.
